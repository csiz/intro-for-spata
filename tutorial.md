Setting shit up
---------------

* Install python 3 from python.org. 
    This is the programming language, duh. Make sure you have "add to PATH" selected; that's the default.

* And git+github from github.com.
    This little program tracks changes and makes it easy to collaborate with others on bigger projects. If
    you want to know more, look up "version control". It's useful outside of programming too.
